# Project Form Validation using HTML, CSS and JavaScript

Form validation with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is a crucial component of web development to ensure the accuracy and security of data submitted through web forms. This process involves verifying user input, providing feedback on errors, and implementing authentication features. Here's an overview of key elements and features in form validation:

1. HTML Forms: The foundation of the validation process is the creation of HTML forms, which allow users to submit data to a web application. Forms collect various types of user input, such as text, numbers, emails, and more.

2. Input Fields: Input fields within the form collect specific data, and HTML attributes like "required" and "pattern" can be used for basic validation directly within the HTML markup.

3. CSS Styles: CSS is used to style and format the form elements, making them user-friendly and visually appealing. Styling can also include error messages or visual cues for invalid input.

4. JavaScript Validation: JavaScript is employed to provide more robust and dynamic form validation.
